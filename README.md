[If you're anything like me](https://xkcd.com/1567/), you've tried every editor under the sun. Maybe you started with higher level ones like [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and gradually branched out to [vim](https://www.vim.org/), [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or (if you're a real programmer) [ed](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ed). Perhaps you started with one and have been steadfast in your unwavering certainty of its superiority. And of course the wide variety of choices available applies to the choice of language doubly so. There are those of you that have a diversity of language experience and those that have chosen your lane with a single tech stack you know and love. Whatever the case, I think that all programmers can relate to a feeling of something missing; a feeling that somewhere out there, there is perfect combination of language and editor that will bring them true enlightenment without and of [the](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1700081/why-is-128-128-false-but-127-127-is-true-when-comparing-integer-wrappers-in-ja) [quirks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2192547/where-is-the-c-auto-keyword-used) [that](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70882092/make-1-2-true) [come](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57456188/why-is-the-result-of-ba-a-a-tolowercase-banana/57456236#57456236) [along](https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs) [with](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4176328/undefined-behavior-and-sequence-points) [other](https://www.seebs.net/faqs/c-iaq.html) [setups](https://xkcd.com/327/). But somehow that combination never seems to arrive. 

Until now that is. 

Wordy is the final iteration of language and IDE design. It combines the effectiveness of a Microsoft Word, a powerful document editing tool with over 30 years of industry experience, with the reliability of some random guy's compiler hobby project with literally now experience in compiler design. For too long the ``.docx`` extension has been associated with business people and writers. It is time to claim it as the extension of the *programmer*.
